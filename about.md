What is Aclevo?
Aclevo is an organization designed with you in mind. Our mission is to be successful, and have a worthy board who encourages members to work hard. Our board, The Aclevo Family, along with our executive staff, are working toward this mission by providing good content, listening to feedback, and maintaining a sturdy workforce. Our teams are always helping each other grow faster. No matter what we call ourselves, Aclevo is here to stay since the year of 2009!

How does it work?
Aclevo is made up of an executive team, multiple departments that each have their own department head, and contributers who help out once in a while. The executive team includes the owner, Reasonably Selenium, and the officers. They make sure that the organization works hard, and becomes successful. The departments, which include Teklik Development, which works on web and application development; Espera Studios, which works on gaming development and also gaming videos; and Platasun Designs, which makes logos and graphics; help make Aclevo stronger and grow faster. Each department has it's own teams that work on their own specific product. Contributors, fans of Aclevo who contribute to our products, also provide feedback to make us better. Anyone can be a contributor, but those who apply for membership get free perks when they join, such as free web space, and access to certain services that only our members get.

How did it start?
Aclevo started as a family of websites and projects. They used innovation to grow faster. Innovations included experimentation with design specs; these included color, contrast, brightness, and many other aspects to see what a good website needed to look good. As time went on, it grew to become a family of organizations. These organizations were administered via a board known as the A.R.T (Aclevo, Reasonably Selenium, and Teklik) Coalition. Many people misunderstood the concept of an organization family, which caused the entire team to get together and restructure as the organization we all know today with multiple departments.

Website Design History
The first design of the Aclevo Website used green and gray color schemes without any Material Design. A program known as Adobe Muse was used to create the website. As time went on, the color scheme changed to blue, purple, and white. Some ideas of Material Design were integrated into the website. At this point in time, Adobe Muse is no longer used. Instead, Drupal is used with few plugins. For the blog, we use jekyll hosted on Github pages.
